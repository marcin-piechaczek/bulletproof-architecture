# **Bulletproof Architecture in the World of Software Development: Insights from Iterations**

Taking on challenges related to software architecture is no easy task. In my attempts to find the perfect project structure, I focused on several iterations, aiming to extract valuable insights.

### First approach

The first iteration was based on a polyrepo approach, using a basic configuration of tools such as eslint, prettier, and typescript. The code was straightforward, but it lacked crucial component reusability. Each new component practically meant starting from scratch, resulting in a significant time investment.

### Second approach

The second approach led me towards a monorepo architecture, utilizing the turborepo project. While it increased reusability, new issues emerged concerning turborepo's performance and the lack of tree shaking optimization. The complexity of the project made maintenance a challenge.

### Third approach

The third iteration involved returning to the polyrepo approach but with additional component configuration, eliminating the need to write them from scratch each time. This approach proves to be ideal for proof-of-concept projects, where minimal time investment translates to quickly achieving desired outcomes.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, it's worth noting that there is no one-size-fits-all bulletproof architecture. Each project structure should be tailored to solve a specific problem. The problem defines the architecture, and my task is to flexibly adapt to changing requirements and project conditions. In the quest for the perfect architecture, it's always crucial to be prepared for subsequent iterations and adjustments.
